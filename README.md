# Claude Code Automation MVP

An MVP application that automates coding tasks using Claude Code in sandboxed environments. Users can submit text prompts describing what they want to develop for a configured GitHub repository, and Claude Code will analyze the codebase, make the necessary changes, and create commits that can be turned into pull requests.

## Features

- ü§ñ **Claude Code Integration**: Leverages Claude Code for intelligent code generation and modification
- üê≥ **Sandboxed Execution**: Runs Claude Code in isolated Docker containers for security
- üîÑ **Git Integration**: Automatically clones repositories, makes commits, and creates pull requests
- üåê **Web Interface**: Clean, modern UI for submitting prompts and reviewing changes
- üìä **Real-time Status**: Live updates on task progress and completion
- üîç **Git Diff Viewer**: Review all changes before creating pull requests

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript and TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Python Flask API with Docker orchestration
- **Automation**: Claude Code running in isolated Alpine Linux containers
- **Git Operations**: GitHub API integration for repository management

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- [Anthropic API Key](https://console.anthropic.com/) for Claude Code
- GitHub Personal Access Token with repo permissions

## Quick Start

1. **Clone and Build**
   ```bash
   git clone <this-repo>
   cd <repo-directory>
   ./build.sh
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**
   - Edit `server/.env` with your Anthropic API key
   - The build script will create this file from the example

3. **Access the Application**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:5000

4. **Get a GitHub Token**
   - Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
   - Create a token with `repo` permissions
   - Use this token in the frontend interface

## Usage

1. **Setup GitHub Token**: Click "Setup GitHub Token" in the frontend and enter your token
2. **Configure Repository**: Enter the GitHub repository URL and branch
3. **Enter Prompt**: Describe what you want Claude Code to develop
4. **Start Task**: Click "Code" to begin the automation process
5. **Review Changes**: View the git diff when the task completes
6. **Create PR**: If satisfied with changes, click "Create PR"

## Example Prompts

- "Add a new API endpoint for user authentication"
- "Fix the responsive design issues on mobile"
- "Add error handling to the database connection logic"
- "Implement input validation for the contact form"
- "Update the styling to match the new design system"

## Environment Variables

### Backend (`server/.env`)
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
FLASK_ENV=development
FLASK_DEBUG=True
```

## API Endpoints

- `POST /start-task` - Start a new Claude Code automation task
- `GET /task-status/<task_id>` - Get task status and progress
- `GET /git-diff/<task_id>` - Retrieve git diff for completed tasks
- `POST /create-pr/<task_id>` - Create a pull request from completed task

## Security Considerations

For this MVP:
- GitHub tokens are handled client-side only
- Tasks run in isolated Docker containers
- No persistent storage of sensitive data
- Direct API communication with Anthropic

For production:
- Implement proper authentication system
- Use GitHub Apps instead of personal tokens
- Add rate limiting and request validation
- Implement proper secret management

## Development

### Running Locally
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop all services
docker-compose down
```

### Frontend Development
```bash
cd async-code-web
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Backend Development
```bash
cd server
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Limitations (MVP)

- No user authentication system
- In-memory task storage (resets on restart)
- Basic error handling
- Single concurrent task per instance
- No task persistence across restarts

## Future Enhancements

- User authentication and session management
- Database persistence (Supabase integration planned)
- Multiple concurrent tasks
- GitHub App integration
- Advanced task scheduling
- Webhook support for repository events
- Task history and analytics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Docker permission errors**: Ensure your user is in the docker group
2. **Port conflicts**: Change ports in docker-compose.yml if needed
3. **API key errors**: Verify your Anthropic API key is correctly set
4. **GitHub token issues**: Ensure token has proper repo permissions

### Logs
```bash
# View all logs
docker-compose logs

# View specific service logs
docker-compose logs backend
docker-compose logs frontend
```

## Contributing

This is an MVP implementation. For production use, consider implementing:
- Proper error handling and validation
- Security hardening
- Performance optimizations
- Comprehensive testing
- Monitoring and logging
