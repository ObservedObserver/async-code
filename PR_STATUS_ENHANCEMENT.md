# PR Status Badge Enhancement

## Summary
Enhanced the task list design on both the main page and tasks list page with PR status badges that show when a task has an associated Pull Request. Users can now directly click on these badges to navigate to the PR.

## What was implemented

### 1. New PRStatusBadge Component (`/components/pr-status-badge.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: A reusable component that displays PR status and provides direct navigation to PRs
- **Features**:
  - Two display variants: `badge` (compact) and `button` (full button style)
  - Two sizes: `sm` and `default`  
  - Clickable with hover effects
  - Shows PR number and Git pull request icon
  - Opens PR in new tab when clicked
  - Only renders when PR data is available

### 2. Main Page Enhancement (`/app/page.tsx`)
- **Location**: Right sidebar task list
- **Implementation**: Added compact PR badges next to task status badges
- **Features**:
  - Small badge format that doesn't disrupt existing layout
  - Shows immediately when tasks have associated PRs
  - Positioned between task status and task metadata

### 3. Tasks List Page Enhancement (`/app/tasks/page.tsx`)
- **Location**: Both in the main task item display and action buttons area
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added larger PR badge in main task metadata area
  - Replaced existing basic PR button with enhanced PR button in actions area
- **Features**:
  - More prominent display of PR status
  - Consistent styling with rest of the interface
  - Better visual hierarchy

## Design Benefits

### User Experience
- **One-click PR access**: Users can directly navigate to PRs without going through task details
- **Visual clarity**: Clear indication of which tasks have associated PRs
- **Consistent interface**: Same component used across different contexts with appropriate sizing

### Developer Experience  
- **Reusable component**: Single component handles all PR badge needs
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper prop interfaces
- **Responsive design**: Adapts to different layout contexts

## Technical Details

### Component Props
```typescript
interface PRStatusBadgeProps {
    prUrl?: string | null;        // PR URL for navigation
